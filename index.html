        <p><em>Your Future Employee</em></p>
        <p>Currently, serving as the Operations and Technology Coordinator, I oversee coordination of the equipment issue desk and game room. This entails the recruitment, hire, training, supervision, evaluation, and termination of undergraduate and graduate staff that operate these areas. Additional duties include the management of 2500+ lockers. My role also serves as the responsible party for all the hardware and software within the Student Recreation Center and its facilities. This includes: research and purchase all computers, printers, fax machines, and internal servers; troubleshoot all hardware, software, and/or user issues; and control access in and out of the facility. My implementation of new strategies to increase efficiency and effectiveness department wide is a key part of forward movement.</p>
